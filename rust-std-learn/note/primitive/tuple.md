# tuple

- A finite heterogeneous sequence, (T, U, ...)
- tuple are finite(有限的). In other words, a tuple has a length. 

- tuple are heterogeneous. this means that each element of the tuple can have a different type.

```rs
("hello", 'c', 5) // (&'static str, char, i32)
```

## Implementations

- due to a teporary restriction in Rust's type system, the following traits are only implemented on tuples of artity 12 or less. Inthe future, this may change:
  - PartialEq
  - Eq
  - PartialOrd
  - Ord
  - Debug
  - Default
  - Hash

- The following traits are implemented for tuples of any length. These traits have implementations that are automactically generated by the compiler, so are not limited by missing language features.
  - Clone
  - Copy
  - Send
  - Sync
  - Upin
  - UnwindSafe
  - RefUnwindSafe
